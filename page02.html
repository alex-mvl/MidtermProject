				<p>Kiss of life formed by S2 Entertainment in 2023 is one to particularly pay attention to especially for fans that have been wanting adults to debut instead of children. The four member girl group consist of members: Julie, Natty, Belle, and Haneul have already released two EPs that show r&b, hip-hop, and pop influences and 4 solo tracks to show the talent of each member individually. 
				</p>
				<p>You might have already noticed a couple of familiar faces within the group. Natty was in reality survival show Sixteen and Idol School which are the shows that led to the formation of Twice and Fromis_9. Julie was a trainee under The Black Label and was known for her rapping in a trainee promotional video. </p>
				<p>In an industry where the debut age is becoming lower and lower, this is a breath of fresh air.</p>
