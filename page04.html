				<p>Since Kpop has become a global phenomenon, it only makes sense that companies would start to see how much they could expand out to the western world by forming global groups and how many global supporters they could bring. 
				</p>
				<p>Recently, there have been two new global girl groups from two different competing companies: HYBE Entertainment and JYP Entertainment. Both groups were formed on a survival show, but while JYP’s girl group, VCHA, was not selected from public voters, HYBE’s, KATSEYE, was. </p>
				<p>Both groups have girls from all over the world representing their country which attracts fans from all over the world! But there have been mixed opinions if it would still be considered Kpop without Koreans?</p>

				<p>Speaking about global girl groups another trend that seems like it is here to stay is Kpop groups coming out with full english singles or full english versions of their songs.</p>
				<p>We have seen them do Japanese versions of their albums and Japanese singles because of the huge music market Japan has. Now, we are seeing Korean companies take the next step in the globalization of Kpop and releasing english singles. </p>
				<p>Now you can sing along fully to your favorite songs!</p>
